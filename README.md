# GumTree Algorithm

A code diff algorithm that works on the abstract syntax tree (AST) level.

It is used to compare two ASTs and produce a list of edit scripts
that can be used to transform the first AST into the second AST.

> We ignored most of the real-world problems and focused on the core algorithm.
> Only the most crucial parts are covered by testing.
